# Welcome to My Personal Website Revamp! 🚀

Hey there, internet wanderer! 👋 I'm in the midst of giving my current website [ruinformatique.ch](https://www.ruinformatique.ch) a serious facelift, and you've just stumbled upon the backstage pass to this digital transformation. Brace yourself for a wild ride as we swap out the old CSS for some Tailwind magic! 💨✨

## Project Overview

Currently, my site is like a digital time capsule, frozen in its static glory. But fear not, because once the first version of this makeover is done, we're thinking of spicing things up with frameworks like React. It's gonna be a whole new level of awesome! 🎉

### What's Cooking?

- **Projects Galore:** This is the treasure trove where I spill the tea on my projects. From fully polished public pieces to those undercover private ventures, you'll find a bit of everything.

- **Service Status:** Ever wonder if my digital minions are hard at work? This section keeps you in the loop on the status of my various services. Spoiler alert: they're usually crushing it!

- **Fresh News:** The first page is the place to be for the hottest updates. News, sneak peeks, and maybe a surprise or two! 🔥

## About Me

In a nutshell, I'm the mastermind behind the pixels. 💡 I juggle projects, tinker with code, and document my journey. Geek vibes and creative sparks are my daily bread.

⚠️ **Warning:** You might stumble upon remnants of the old CSS, but don't fret. It's all part of the master plan to elevate this digital space to new heights!

Feel free to roam around, and stay tuned for the grand reveal! 🌐✨
