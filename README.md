# Welcome to My Personal Website Revamp! 🚀

Hey there, internet wanderer! 👋 I'm currently in the trenches, giving my trusty old website [ruinformatique.ch](https://www.ruinformatique.ch) a snazzy makeover. You've just scored the backstage pass to witness this digital transformation unfold. Get ready for a rollercoaster as we swap out the old CSS for some Tailwind magic! 💨✨

## Project Overview

⚠️ **Warning:** You might stumble upon remnants of the old CSS, but don't fret.<br>
It's all part of the master plan to elevate this digital space to new heights!

Right now, my site is like a digital time capsule, frozen in its static glory. But fear not, because once the first version of this makeover is done, we're thinking of cranking things up with frameworks like React. Brace yourself for a whole new level of awesome! 🎉

### What's Cooking?

- **Projects Galore:** This is the treasure trove where I spill the tea on my projects. From fully polished public pieces to those undercover private ventures, you'll find a bit of everything.

- **Service Status:** Ever wonder if my digital minions are hard at work? This section keeps you in the loop on the status of my various services. Spoiler alert: they're usually crushing it!

- **Fresh News:** The first page is the place to be for the hottest updates. News, sneak peeks, and maybe a surprise or two! 🔥

## How to Compile the Project

```bash
npm run build
